# Google

- Google started the Tekton project and contributes to it heavily
- Our goal for the project is to serve as a set of building blocks for CI/CD systems on top of Kubernetes
- We are interested in making sure it runs great on GCP, GKE and Anthos
- We are passionate about fostering a vibrant ecosystem for Tekton and having a catalog of maintained Tasks that can be shared and reused
